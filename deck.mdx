# What are we trying to solve? 🤔

<div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', display: 'flex', margin: 'auto' }}>

- Wholesalers still have a pen and paper order-taking process from retailers
- Wholesalers update payment collected from their retailers in the book. So they find it difficult to manage.

# What is the solution? 💡


<div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', color: '#6B7280'}}>

Vyap is a chat-like app, which works as a local inventory network connecting wholesalers with local retailers
