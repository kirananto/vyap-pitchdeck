# Problem & Opportunity 🤔

<div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', display: 'flex' }}>

- Even in 2021, Wholesalers still have an old school pen and paper inventory order-taking process from SMB’s
- Wholesalers update payment collected from their retailers in the ledger. So find it difficult to manage it.
